# Pokemon Catching Guide API

Pokemon Catching Guide API is a simple REST API built with NodeJS and Express.

It is used by the frontend website located in the repository [Pokemon Catching Guide Website](https://github.com/peroxy/pokemon-catch-guide-website).

It serves data generated by the CSV encounter generator ([Pokemon Catch Guide](https://github.com/peroxy/pokemon-catch-guide)). 
The CSV files are parsed and inserted into a local Sqlite database for easier usage.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the API.

```shell
cd pokemon-catch-guide-api
npm install
```

## Usage

Please look at the `package.json` scripts section to run a specific script:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "prestart": "npm run build",
    "start": "node .",
    "live-reload": "nodemon src/app.ts",
    "insert-from-csv-to-database": "ts-node ./src/db/csv_data/csv_inserter.ts"
  }
```

- Run the REST API:
    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```
- Run the REST API with live reload:
    ```shell
    npm run live-reload
    ```
- Run CSV inserter (inserts CSV data into local sqlite database):
    ```shell
    npm run insert-from-csv-to-datbase
    ```
  
### API

The API runs on port 8080 if environment variable `SERVER_PORT` is not specified.

Every API route requires a bearer token to be specified in the `Authorization` header. 
For example, if your `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `development` you may use the default token `pokemon`:
- HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer pokemon` 

On `production` environment you will have to specify an environment variable `API_SECRET_HASH` that represents your bcrypt hashed secret.
